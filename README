Synopsis

    feedback ‹Result› ‹GrpDir› ‹Feedback› \
             ‹Groups› ‹minTotal› ‹failMax› ‹minEach› ‹Max› \
             ‹Rating›*


Output

  * For each ‹group› found in the ‹Groups› database, an overview of
    gained points will be written into the file

        ‹GrpDir›/‹group›/‹Feedback›

    The format being one line per assignment, showing the assignment
    number, points gained, the points required for 100%, and the
    percentage gained.  A `~` indicates that no rating has happened,
    or div/zero for the percentage.  The header comment contains the
    overall percentage.

  * For each student found in the ‹Groups› database, an overview of
    gained points will be written into the file ‹Result›.  The format
    being one line per student, showing the student identifier, a list
    of gained points (or `~` if no grading has happened), and as a
    comment the percentage achieved.  The heading comment contains the
    points required to achieve 100%.


Input

  * The ‹Groups› file has the format

        ‹group› ‹flag› ‹member›*

    Where ‹group› is the group's name, ‹flag› indicates the assigned
    tutorial or `~` if none, and ‹member› is the member's
    identification, usually the university email address.

  * A student is marked FAILED if the gained points (including bonus
    points) are below ‹minTotal› percent of the totally available
    regular points (excluding bonus points).

  * A student is marked FAILED if more than ‹failMax› exercises have
    been rated (including bonus points) with less than ‹minEach›
    percent of the regular points (excluding bonus points) available
    in this exercise.

  * The file ‹Max› contains one line per assignment, showing the
    number of points required to achieve 100%, and the number of
    available bonus points.  This file determines the number of
    assignments.

  * Each tutor provides a file ‹Rating› with the following format:

        ‹group› ‹gained›*

    Where ‹group› identifies a group, and ‹gained› is the amount of
    points for the corresponding exercise.  ‹gained› may be `~` iff no
    grading has happened (maybe the group is closed).


Consistency checks performed

  * A student cannot gain points from different groups for the same
    tutorial.

  * A group cannot be rated more than once by different tutors for the
    same assignment.

  * Per rating, a tutor cannot grant more than the points required for
    100% plus the bonus points.

  * In the tutor's rating files, there must be at least one entry for
    every group and every assignment (there may be additional ones).
