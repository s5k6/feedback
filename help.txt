Output

  * For each group found in the {groups definition file}, an overview
    of gained points will be written into a file matching the
    {individual feedback file pattern}, with the mandatory `%`
    replaced by the groups name.

    The format is one line per assignment, showing the assignment
    number, points gained, the points required for 100%, and the
    percentage gained.  A `~` indicates that no rating has happened,
    or div/zero for the percentage.

    The header comment contains the overall percentage.

[ requested feature: Give students individual percentage, if member of
different groups ]

  * For each student found in the {groups definition file}, an
    overview of gained points will be written into the {overview
    file}.

    The format is one line per student, showing the student
    identifier, whether he passes, the achieved percent, the margin of
    points above failure, the maximum number of further exercises he
    may fail, and a list of gained points (or `~` if no grading has
    happened).

    The header comment contains the points required to achieve 100%,
    the required percentage to pass, the total number of available
    bonus points, the minimum percentage required per assignment, and
    a listing of the regular points available in the individual
    exercises.


Input

  * The {groups definition file} file has the format

        ‹group› ‹flag› ‹member›*

    Where ‹group› is the group's name, ‹flag› indicates the assigned
    tutorial or `~` if none, and ‹member› is the member's
    identification, usually the university email address.

  * A student is marked FAILED if the gained points (including bonus
    points) are below the {required percentage per exercise},
    calculated from the regular points available (excluding bonus
    points).

[rework from here ...


  * A student is marked FAILED if more than ‹failMax› exercises have
    been rated (including bonus points) with less than ‹minEach›
    percent of the regular points (excluding bonus points) available
    in this exercise.

  * The file ‹Max› contains one line per assignment, showing the
    number of points required to achieve 100%, and the number of
    available bonus points.  This file determines the number of
    assignments.

  * Each tutor provides a file ‹Rating› with the following format:

        ‹group› ‹gained›*

    Where ‹group› identifies a group, and ‹gained› is the amount of
    points for the corresponding exercise.  ‹gained› may be `~` iff no
    grading has happened (maybe the group is closed).


Consistency checks performed

  * A student cannot gain points from different groups for the same
    tutorial.

  * A group cannot be rated more than once by different tutors for the
    same assignment.

  * Per rating, a tutor cannot grant more than the points required for
    100% plus the bonus points.

  * In the tutor's rating files, there must be at least one entry for
    every group and every assignment (there may be additional ones).
