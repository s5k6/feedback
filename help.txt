Output

  * For each group found in the {groups definition file}, an overview
    of gained points will be written into a file matching the
    {individual feedback file pattern}, with the mandatory `%`
    replaced by the groups name.

    The format is one line per assignment, showing the assignment
    number, points gained, the points required for 100%, and the
    percentage gained.  A `~` indicates that no rating has happened,
    or div/zero for the percentage.

    The header comment contains the overall percentage.

[ requested feature: Give students individual percentage, if member of
different groups ]

  * For each student found in the {groups definition file}, an
    overview of gained points will be written into the {overview
    file}.

    The format is one line per student, showing the student
    identifier, whether he passes, the achieved percent, the margin of
    points above failure, the maximum number of further exercises he
    may fail, and a list of gained points (or `~` if no grading has
    happened).

    The header comment contains the points required to achieve 100%,
    the required percentage to pass, the total number of available
    bonus points, the minimum percentage required per assignment, and
    a listing of the regular points available in the individual
    exercises.


Input

  * The {groups definition file} file has the format

        ‹group› ‹flag› ‹member›*

    Where ‹group› is the group's name, ‹flag› indicates the assigned
    tutorial or `~` if none, and ‹member› is the member's
    identification, usually the university email address.

  * The {file containing regular and bonus points per exercise} has
    one line per exercise, column one holds the regular points
    (sufficient to achieve 100%), column two holds the additional
    bonus points.  This file determines the number of assignments.

  * An exercise is considered FAILED if the gained points (including
    bonus points) are below the {required percentage per exercise},
    calculated from the regular points available (excluding bonus
    points).

  * A student is marked FAILED if more than the {acceptable number of
    failed exercises} have occurred.  This failure is final.

  * A student is marked FAILED if less than the {required percentage
    overall} has been reached, calculated from the regular points
    available (excluding bonus points).  This failure may be
    temporary, since it can be fixed in subsequent exercises.

  * Each tutor provides a {tutor's points file} with the following
    format:

        ‹group› ‹gained›*

    Where ‹group› identifies a group, and ‹gained› is the amount of
    points for the corresponding exercise.  ‹gained› may be `~` iff no
    grading has happened (maybe the group is closed), or that
    particular assignment has been reviewed by another tutor.


Consistency checks performed

  * A student cannot gain points from different groups for the same
    tutorial.

  * A group cannot be rated more than once by different tutors for the
    same assignment.

  * Per rating, a tutor cannot grant more than the regular points plus
    the bonus points.

  * In the tutor's rating files, there must be at least one entry for
    every group and every assignment (there may be additional ones).
